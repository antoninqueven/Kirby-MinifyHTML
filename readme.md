# Kirby HTML Minifier

To install, simply drop the **minifyhtml** folder into the plugins directory: ``site/plugins``.

**Disclaimer:** *While the plugin is working without issue for me, further testing is still needed as there may be conflicts with Kirbyâ€™s internal output buffer method.*

This is a temporary fix until a hook can be used in the plugin.

Many thanks to Stephen Clay for his excellent HTML minifier class.
