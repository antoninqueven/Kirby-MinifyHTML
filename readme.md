# Kirby Minify HTML Plugin

To install, simply drop the **minifyhtml** folder into the plugins directory: ``site/plugins``.

**Disclaimer:** *While the plugin is working without issue for me, further testing is still needed as there may be conflicts with Kirbyâ€™s internal output buffer method.*

This is a temporary fix until a hook can be used in the plugin.
More info about that [here](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/120).


Many thanks to Stephen Clay for his excellent [HTML minifier class](https://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/min/lib/Minify/HTML.php).
